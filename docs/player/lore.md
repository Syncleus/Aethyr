# Canonical Lore

At present the **core distribution** ships with only *minimal* built-in loreâ€”allowing server operators to craft their own stories without having to retcon an existing universe.  The default world contains a single *Starter Zone* area with placeholder rooms such as *Sunny Meadow* and *Dark Forest*.

This page will expand automatically as you, the community, contribute more areas and quests.  Until then, enjoy the blank canvas! ðŸŽ¨
