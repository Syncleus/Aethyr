#  These steps drive the *display layout* scenarios defined in
#  `tests/integration/layout.feature`.  They exercise the public TCP interface
#  of a live Aethyr server (boot-strapped via the shared `ServerHarness`).
#  All interactions are intentionally performed *over the wire* to maintain a
#  true end-to-end perspective whilst still harnessing Ruby helpers for data
#  marshalling.
